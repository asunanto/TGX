    1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?
       As games these days can be quite expensive(especially nintendo switch games), people on a strict budget(such as students) might consider to go on a budget and buy second hand games for a cheaper price.
       
    2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?
       There are online services such as gumtree that caters to these needs. However, they do not have game trades as a focus. To address this niche area of the market, we would be providing a platform and service where we users can buy and sell games online
       
    3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.
       Our project aims to create a platform where users can post games they would like to sell as well as buying games from the post listed.
